# fMRI-interface-Psychopy
This is a short Python script that syncs the MR scanner at the GIfMI (UZ Gent) with your experiment.  

## Included scripts 
- configSerial: defines functions to initialize the scanner interface, wait for the first pulse to arrive from the scanner, and close the interface
- runExperiment: example of how to call these functions in your main experiment script

## Requirements
Tested with Psychopy (http://www.psychopy.org/) and the Siemens Trio 3T scanner located at the GIfMI in Gent (http://gifmi.ugent.be/). 

## Bugs / Improvements
If you find bugs in this script or have suggestions for improvement, please report both here https://github.com/CCN-github/fMRI-interface-Psychopy/issues
